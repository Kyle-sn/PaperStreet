# PaperStreet Automated Trading System
An automated trading system written primarily in java utilizing the Intractive Brokers TWS API. I started building it at the beginning of 2022 as a way to practice my java as well as to create my own personal trading system that I can use for personal strategies.

My goal was to successfully place a trade in my personal trading account using the automated trading system. I have been able to do so successfully following the below workflow.

I have achieved my goal of placing a trade in production, but I do not currently have the skills research profitable strategies and so I do not plan on running this system continuously for the forseeable future. The major building blocks of an automated trading system are in place, but there is a lot of room to iterate and improve processes. The system is able to trade any product IBKR offers (and that the associated account is permissioned to trade) and so if I ever want to risk it all and try starting my own trading shop, I at least have a foundation built that more technical developers can use as a starting point.

I hope to keep up with this project in my free time, but I do not plan on making updates on a regular schedule.

### Future improvements I plan on making:
- Add tests (lol)
- Create utility scripts to clean up directories
- Create an error monitoring system (log watcher with real-time alerting)
- Create bash scripts to be used by cron jobs to launch various jobs
- Improve the python backtesting environment
- Add CI/CD workflows
